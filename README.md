# Source for generating Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral's website.

This repository holds the markdown files and PDFs used in http://ololc.org.

The website is build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a free, open source static website builder.
And the site is styled with the [blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish) theme.

Pushes to the `master` branch cause the site to be rebuilt and deployed.  The result can be found at http://ololc.org.
